    Nova 14.0.0 release is including a lot of new features and bugfixes. It can
    be extremely hard to mention all the changes we introduced during that
    release but we beg you to read at least the upgrade section which describes
    the required modifications that you need to do for upgrading your cloud
    from 13.0.0 (Mitaka) to 14.0.0 (Newton).

    That said, a few major changes are worth to notice here. This is not an
    exhaustive list of things to notice, rather just important things you need
    to know :

      - Latest API microversion supported for Newton is v2.38
      - Nova now provides a new placement RESTful API endpoint that is for
        the moment optional where Nova compute nodes use it for providing
        resources. For the moment, the nova-scheduler is not using it but we
        plan to check the placement resources for Ocata. In case you plan to
        rolling-upgrade the compute nodes between Newton and Ocata, please
        look in the notes below how to use the new placement API.
      - Cells V2 now supports booting instances for one cell v2 only. We plan
        to add a multi-cell support for Ocata. You can prepare for Ocata now
        by creating a cellv2 now using the nova-manage related commands, but
        configuring Cells V2 is still fully optional for this cycle.
      - Nova is now using Glance v2 API for getting image resources.
      - API microversions 2.36 and above now deprecate the REST resources in
        Nova used to proxy calls to other service type APIs (eg. /os-volumes).
        We'll still supporting those until we raise our minimum API version
        to 2.36 which is not planned yet (we're supporting v2.1 as of now) but
        you're encouraged to stop using those resources and rather calling the
        other services that provide those natively.
